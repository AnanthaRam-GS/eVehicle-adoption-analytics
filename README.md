## Business Analytics of Electric Vehicle Markets

This repository contains the capstone project for the analysis of Electric Vehicle Adoption, focusing on the analysis of **global electric vehicle (EV) adoption, market performance, resale behavior, charging infrastructure readiness, and financial market signals**.  
The project combines secondary datasets from reliable public sources with primary survey data to derive actionable business insights.

## Primary Survey:

In addition to secondary datasets, a **public survey** titled  
**“Global Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption & Market Behaviour Survey”**  
was conducted using Google Forms to collect primary data on:
- EV awareness and adoption intent
- Perceived benefits and barriers
- Resale confidence
- Infrastructure perception
- Market and investment outlook

Survey responses are anonymized and used strictly for academic analysis.

## Methodology:

The project follows a structured **Business Analytics workflow**:
1. Data collection and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Consumer and regional segmentation
4. Predictive and inferential modeling
5. Time-series and financial market analysis
6. Business interpretation and validation

The analysis is performed using **Python**, with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn.
